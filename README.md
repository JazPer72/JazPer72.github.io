# About Me
## **You'll likely find me:**
* Hiking the _North Carolina Mountains to Sea Trail_ with my best friend and my foxhound, Bagel
* Reading **_yet another_** N.K. Jemison novel
* Playing _Persona_, _Octopath Traveler_, _Red Dead Redemption 2_
* Telling Netflix I'm **_still_** watching some documentary
* Throwing things in an Instapot and hoping it's tasty
## **I'm Following:**
 * Jack Rhysider's [_Darknet Diaries_][Darknet Diaries]
   > **"True stories from the dark side of the internet"**

   * One random day this show appeared in my "Recommended" and I've been hooked on cybersecurity ever since. I have interest in doing Incident Response or Penetration Testing someday and [Darknet Diaries][Darknet Diaries] is to blame.
 * [North Carolina Public Radio](https://www.wunc.org/)  
   > **"Bringing the World Home to You"**  

   * I'm a proud WUNC sustainer! I love the variety of programs and news coverage on this station. Three of my favorite programs are Due South, Sound Opinions, and Wait Wait...Don't Tell Me!
 * [New York Times Games](https://www.nytimes.com/crosswords)
   > **"Since the launch of The Crossword in 1942, The Times has captivated solvers by providing engaging word and logic games."**

   * Wordle, Strands, Connections and the Mini Crossword are some of my favorite highlights every day.
