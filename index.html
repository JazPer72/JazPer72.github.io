                I am an aspiring cybersecurity professional. My current career is in Quality Assurance and I hope to leverage my 7+ years of experience in that industry to 
                transition into a "Governance, Regulatory, and Auditing" or "Incident Response" cybersecurity specialization. In my spare time I like to play role playing games
                such as Final Fantasy and Persona. I have a one-year-old mischievious tricolor foxhound named Bagel that I love to take on hikes.
